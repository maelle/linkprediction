\title{University of Warsaw co-authorship network}
\format{
An \code{igraph} object with undirected graph with 1486 vertices and 7505 edges, and the following attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{affiliation} -- Vertex attribute identifying groups of departments:
natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, other (other departments of
UW), and external (co-authors who are not employees of UW)
\item \code{color}, \code{size}, \code{label} -- Vertex attributes for easy plotting. Color corresponds
to the \code{affiliation} attribute.
\item \code{p1} -- Logical edge attribute. It is \code{TRUE} if researchers incident on
that edge co-authored at least one publication in period 1.
\item \code{p2} -- Logical edge attribute. It is \code{TRUE} if researchers incident on
that edge co-authored at least one publication in period 2.
