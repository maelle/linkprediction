# Leicht-Holme-Newman Global Index

# Recursive similarity measure based on all paths in a graph
#
# This function calculates vertex similarity based on the concept, that two
#   nodes are similar, when their neighbors are similar. Smaller \eqn{\theta}
#   assings more weight on shorter paths (closer neighbors are more important).
